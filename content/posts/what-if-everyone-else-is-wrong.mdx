Yes everyone put their trust on him, everyone believe that he will achieve everything that he wants, everyone believe that he will be able to make it. But what if everyone is wrong?

What if he's not that good?

What if he's not that predetermined?

What if he's not that preordained?

What if he himself didn't even believe in himself?

What if he even struggled to accomplish little things that everyone can't even imagine there's such things?

He's not that good, he's not worth people's trusts, It's just not makes sense how everyone think of him, how can they think he will make it?

This is him, a simple man with too much complicated things in his head, a man with lack of confidence, patience and lack of everything you named it.

This is him, a man who always try to do better when he knows he can't do better.

This is him, a man who can gain trust and respect from anyone else but himself.

This is him and he's never enough.

> What if everyone else is wrong? What if he's wrong? What if he's not worth it? What if he's just a waste of time? What if he's just a waste of space? What if he's just a waste of everything?

What if, what if, what if.
