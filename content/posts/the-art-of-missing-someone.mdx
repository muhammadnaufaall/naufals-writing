There’s an art to missing someone, a delicate balance between longing and remembering. For me, this art is most vividly painted by the absence of her. It's been a journey of emotions, memories, and reflections that have deepened my appreciation for her and our time together.

I miss the little things the most. The way she’d smile at me, the sound of her laughter, and even the quiet moments we’d share just being together. It’s these small, everyday details that linger in my mind and make her absence feel so profound.

Every day holds reminders of her. A song on my Spotify playlist, which was hers at first but I just claimed it as mine, the matcha that she will always order, or even a phrase she used to say. These triggers are both sweet and painful, bringing a rush of fond memories and a pang of longing. I find myself smiling at the recollection of her quirks and habits, wishing she were here to share these moments with me.

Nights are the hardest. Lying in bed, the world quiet and still, my thoughts often drift to her. The silence now feels heavier without her voice to fill it. It’s in these quiet moments that I feel her absence the most.

We try to stay connected despite the distance. Our calls have become lifelines, bridging the gap and bringing a sense of closeness. Seeing her face, hearing her voice, but it’s not the same as having her here. I cherish our time with calls, yet I long for the day we can be together in person again.

Thinking about the future keeps me going. I imagine the day we’ll reunite, the joy of being in her presence once more. I plan the places we’ll go, the things we’ll do, the new memories we’ll create. These thoughts bring a sense of hope and excitement, a light at the end of this tunnel of longing.

Missing her has given me a chance to reflect. I realize how much she means to me, how deeply she’s woven into the fabric of my life. Her influence, her support, her love. This time apart has made me more grateful for the bond we share and more determined to nurture it.

### Finding Strength

There’s strength in missing someone. It teaches patience and the value of love. Each day apart is a testament, a reminder that what we have is worth waiting for. It’s a challenging experience, but it’s also one that brings growth and a deeper understanding of what it means to truly care for someone.

> Missing someone isn’t just about the pain of their absence. It’s also about the beauty of the memories, the strength of the bond, and the hope for the future.

So, here’s to the art of missing someone – a testament to the love we hold, the memories we cherish, and the anticipation of what’s to come. To Anya, wherever you are (probably you are reading this at your kostan while lying in your bed), know that you are missed deeply and loved immensely. Until we meet again, I’ll keep painting this picture of longing and love, one memory at a time.
