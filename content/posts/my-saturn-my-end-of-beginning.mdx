Your presence is a gift, your mind is a wonder, and your heart is a treasure. I am grateful for the time we've spent together, the memories we've created, and the love we've shared. You are my Saturn, my end of beginning, and the most exciting thing I've ever imagined.

Thank you for bringing joy into every day. Your laugh and boundless energy make my life so much better. I cherish the moments we've shared, the adventures we've embarked on, and the dreams we've dared to dream together.

I am so grateful for your deep caring and understanding. Thank you for never failing to surprise me in the most beautiful ways that make me feel more loved than I've ever felt.

I just want to live inside your brain. I love that you lead with love and are so aware of the impact you have on others.

I am so grateful for your kindness, your generosity, and your unwavering support. You are my rock, my confidant, and my greatest cheerleader. I am so lucky to have you in my life.

Sometimes when my luck is running out, I look at your picture and remember, the blessings that fell into my life and I would love you in all of this until the very last star in the sky burnt out into obvilion.

The idea of our future together fills me with excitement and hope. I can't wait to see where life takes us, what adventures we'll embark on, and what dreams we'll chase. I know that with you by my side, anything is possible.

> That idea is the most exciting thing I've ever imagined.

_I love you._
