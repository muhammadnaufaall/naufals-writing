Have you ever felt like your heart is racing, your palms are sweaty, and your mind is a whirlwind of thoughts? No, you’re not nervous, and you’re not facing a life-threatening situation. You’re just making someone wait. And it’s hurting you.

How dare you make someone so special—someone who always cares about you, supports you, and loves you with a pure heart—wait? Someone you love?

Are you really worth it? Are you that special? Do you truly love them?

Loving someone means trying your best to make them happy. And do you think making them wait is making them happy? No, it’s not. You’re hurting them. You’re hurting yourself.

So, are you really worth it?

Making someone wait, especially someone who means the world to you, feels like a betrayal. It’s like you’re failing at the very essence of love—caring for them. You can almost feel the weight of the minutes passing by, each one adding to the guilt that gnaws at you. The pressure builds, and you start questioning yourself.

“Why am I doing this? Why can’t I just be there for them, now, when they need me the most?”

It’s not that you don’t want to be there; it’s just that sometimes life gets in the way. But even when there are valid reasons, it doesn’t make the guilt any easier to bear. You find yourself stuck between wanting to explain, wanting to be understood, and the fear that they’ll see right through you—that they’ll realize you’re just not trying hard enough.

So, are you trying hard enough?

Are you truly doing everything you can? Or are you letting excuses become barriers? The truth is, when you care deeply about someone, you don’t just try—you make it happen. You find a way, even if it’s difficult, even if it means sacrificing something else. Because love is about priorities, and when you love someone, they become yours.

But if you’re honest with yourself, you might realize that sometimes, you’re not giving it your all. Maybe you’re tired, maybe you’re overwhelmed, or maybe you’re scared of not being enough. But making them wait is not the answer.

It’s time to ask yourself: What’s really holding you back? Are you afraid of disappointing them? Or maybe you’re afraid of what it means to truly commit, to be fully present, to give them your all.

Because making someone wait is more than just a delay; it’s a message. It says, “You’re important, but not important enough.” And that’s not the message you want to send to someone you love.

When you make someone wait, you’re not just postponing a moment; you’re creating distance. You’re telling them, even if unintentionally, that something else—something less important—is taking precedence over them. And that hurts. It’s a slow, quiet kind of hurt that can chip away at trust and affection over time.

But the worst part? You know it’s happening. Deep down, you’re aware that you’re letting them down. You’re letting yourself down. That’s where the guilt comes in, gnawing at the edges of your conscience, reminding you that you could have done more, that you could have been better.

You must do better.

_I’m sorry for making you wait. I’m trying my best. I hope you understand._
