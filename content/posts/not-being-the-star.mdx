There comes a time when we must confront the gap between our dreams and our reality. For me, this moment is now. I find myself reflecting on the aspirations I once held and the person I thought I would become. And in this reflection, I feel the weight of unmet expectations – both mine and those of others.

> I'm sorry for not being the star you thought I'd be.

When I was younger, my dreams were vast and boundless. I imagined a future filled with remarkable achievements, a life that would shine brightly and inspire others. I believed that if I worked hard enough, anything was possible. But as the years have passed, I've come to understand that life is rarely so straightforward.

The path to success is often winding and unpredictable. Despite my best efforts, there have been obstacles I couldn't overcome, opportunities that slipped through my fingers, and moments of doubt that have held me back. Each setback has felt like a personal failure, a reminder that I am not living up to the potential others saw in me – or the potential I saw in myself.

It's hard to face the disappointment in the eyes of those who believed in me. I think about the sacrifices my family made, Anya who always try to be presented for me, the friends who supported me, and the mentors who guided me. Their faith in my abilities has been a source of strength, but also a source of pressure. I wanted so badly to make them proud, to fulfill the promise they saw in me. <mark>But life has a way of humbling us. The reality is, not all dreams come true (not yet). And that's okay (maybe). </mark>

To those who believed in me, I hope you can understand that I am still a work in progress. My journey may not look like the shining success story we once imagined, but it is my own. It is filled with its own moments of beauty, joy, and quiet triumphs.

I'm sorry for not meeting the expectations placed upon me, but I'm also grateful for the journey I've taken. It's a path that has made me more compassionate, more understanding, and more human.

So here's to the dreamers who haven't reached their stars yet – or perhaps, ever will. Our worth is not measured by our accomplishments alone, but by the love, effort, and perseverance we bring to our lives.

And to myself, and anyone else who needs to hear it: It's okay to be where you are. Your journey is valid, your struggles are real, and your dreams – no matter how far away they seem – are still a part of you. Keep believing, keep striving, and most importantly, keep being kind to yourself.

_I'm sorry for not being the star you thought I'd be. But I promise to keep shining in my own way, however imperfectly._
